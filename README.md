# Brute-force-Binary-Counter-5-bits
- This repository shows a simple binary counter of 5-bits. i.e. we have count from 0 to 31 in sequence and in binary. 
- Depicted by 5 green-LED connected to Raspberry-Pi 4 board.
- Used 5 GPIO pins for each LED.
- This is a brute force approch, which is obvious from the python code. As this is a beginner approch on how to use the GPIO pins on any board.
